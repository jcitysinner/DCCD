			<p>The Dominican Republic and Haiti have a long and difficult history in agricultural production, especially the production of sugar cane for the French and Spanish empires. The DCCD is critical of food aid, thus we support projects and public programs that improve the capacity of the local economy and supports social justice initiatives in access to land, education and training that are working to improve the situation of many Dominicans and Haitians who work in and beyond the sugar industry.</p>
			<p>The privatization and decline of sugar production has resulted in increasingly precarious working conditions for cane cutters and other agricultural workers where even jobs with low wages, long  hours and dangerous conditions are difficult to find. Since 2005, the DCCD has supported two training farms where mature Haitian migrants and come to learn techniques in organic food production to expand their skills, and the food is sold at a reduced rate to local bateyes. We are also supporting the development of a government run training program that will include agricultural production and marketing for youth. Further, the DCCD supports the work of agricultural cooperatives who have organized and entered the Fair Trade market such as coffee producers La Esperanza and cocoa producers CONACADO.</p>
